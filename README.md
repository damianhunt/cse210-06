Final Project

Space-Fighter

Getting Started:
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the __main__.py file.

Space-Fighter is a game that has a player controlled space-ship who needs to shoot all the enemy ships to fight through each wave where it gets more difficult as you survive. The game ends when the player loses all their lives.
